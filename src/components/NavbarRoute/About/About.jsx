              Hi , I am Md Jahangir Alam, a dedicated and enthusiastic React
              front-end developer. Over the past six months, I have been honing
              my skills in web development, specializing in React.js for
              front-end development. I also possess something knowledge of
              Express.js for server-side development and MongoDB for working
              with databases. This allows me to tackle end-to-end development
              tasks and build robust, scalable web applications.
